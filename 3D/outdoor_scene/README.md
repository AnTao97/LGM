This folder contains codes for the [SemanticKITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org/) datasets. The codes are built from [Cylinder3D](https://github.com/xinge008/Cylinder3D).

We provide two versions of `spconv`. Both versions performance the same results. The differences between `spconv 1.x` and `spconv 2.x` can be found in this [link](https://github.com/xinge008/Cylinder3D/issues/107#issuecomment-1592291831).
